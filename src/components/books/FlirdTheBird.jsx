					Deep in the colossal mountains , there was a fantastically big ,
					stunning , breath-taking forest where there lived millions of quick
					growing , beautiful plants and shy , noisy animals . The forest had
					unbelievable sights , everywhere you looked there were jade green
					leaves connected to huge , lumpy branches standing like giant guards ,
					guarding the green grass-covered ground to protect from the strong sun
					rays above . In the canopy above , birds sang incredible songs and the
					wind whispered secretly while brave tigers , lions and enormous
					elephants hunted for food to survive.The warm wind made a lovely
					breeze, and sent a wonderful smell attracting busy bees buzzing
					through to collect their sweet nectar . Hundreds of dreadful noises ,
					which were mostly the thumping of massive feet of gigantic animals
					,echoed through the air along with the sound of little , tiny branches
					and twigs breaking under the colossal animal’s wide and heavy feet.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the dark forest , there lived a medium sized animal called the
					Flird . This animal has a fluffy tiny tail , and it ears are as useful
					as tools so it could hear from miles away. It flew silently above the
					tropical forest , so no one would hear him easily . Flird didn’t like
					to be noticed in the busy ,buzzy forest below . Every morning and
					night, he would camouflage to catch his delicious prey.His favorite
					food was fish it was also easy to catch . He lived in the tallest ,
					tree tops that are as tall as giants.
				</p>
				<p>
					One winter night, the temperature was -10 degree no one wanted to come
					out but Flird was flying to a far away lake.Finally, he reached the
					lake and then as quick as a lighting he dived into the lake when he
					was up in the air the snow storm was more frightening then ever. Flird
					was not scared because he was alway flying in the storm when ever he
					wanted or not . Suddenly, he was lost in the he tried to land but he
					was not sure if it was a good place to land or a bad place to land so
					he kept flying for days and days until his wings were to to even move
					a muscle.Then he fainted when he was flying in the mid air!
				</p>
				<p>
					Then woke up he was on a mysterious island.There was mist all around
					him , he tried to move his wing but it would not move.When the mist
					was gone, there were lot’s of sand on his body.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Why is there sand on my body?”thought Flird. Then a shadow appeared.
					Flird was frightened.”Was it a witch?Or is it a lion, tiger or
					something more frightening or eerie….” thought Flird, almost fainting.
					Then the shadow began to turn to a small figure, the shadow became
					more and more clear to see.It was a family of mouse deer and they look
					very curious because they had never ever seen a animal same as Flird.
					Flird tried to explain to them what had happened and his name.
					Unfortunately they did not speak the same language.He tried to play
					charades but sadly they still could not understand. Flird really
					really really wanted to give up until….He saw a great, giant , big
					figure coming from above.As quick as a flash , the figure landed
					beside Flird and ask
