					In a small village near the rivers,there lived a girl and her name was
					Lavinda.She was from Europe,France.She has purple eyes,blond hair and
					her lips were as red as rose.She always wore her pink silk dress to
					move silently and she wore that dress because it matched her eyes. Her
					favorite sport was Tag.Her hobby was reading she loved reading because
					it was fun and made her happy she almost read all the books in town!In
					the night time she liked to have little bit of time to walk in the
					village.Lavinda had a friendly family.
				</p>
				<p>
					On a fateful night before Christmas, she was walking by the
					riverside.Most villager called it the ‘River of Fear’ because many
					cases of ghostly sightings had happened there.The snow was three
					inches high,the lake was as cold as ice and was frozen by the -40
					degree temperatures.The river was buried by the cold snow and the snow
					was barely moving in the cold weather.The snow made a nice,clean
					carpet in the village.Lavinda brought a candle because her biggest
					fear ever was the darkness.But still it was dark,the storm clouds were
					gathering and she knew there was a giant storm prepared to come. So
					she was having a quick walk but the storm was earlier than it
					was.Things were about to go terribly wrong.Gradually, the clouds were
					gathering,and becoming darker and darker and darker!
				</p>
				<p>
					She saw a shadow in the corner of her eye.She didn’t mind because the
					trees were making strange shapes.Then, lightening struck the edge of
					the river. The suspicious shadow appeared again behind her.The
					mysterious shadow pushed her in the cold,scary river.Luckily, she knew
					how to swim.She was a good swimmer, with sonic and dazzling speed she
					swam to the riverbank safely.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was cold so she ran home slowly.The snow splashed into her face so
					it made it hard to see.The snow was getting bigger with every step she
					took.She was slow because her dress was frozen from the low
					temperature.Her family asked her questions about the freaky shadow
					case.The happy village wasn’t bothered about that, they had been
					through more eerie,beastly and threatening cases.Soon the weird shadow
					was forgotten, and the village returned to a busy and joyous place.The
					shadow never seemed to bother the little village again.No one expected
					to see another spooky case happen about the shadow.Everything seemed
					so peaceful,as perfect as a pearl. Den Den Den!
				</p>
				<p>
					After the night she almost drowned,she had kept nightmares that kept
					bothering her.She had wished,prayed,hoped and begged nothing
					terrifying would happen to her because it kept on distracting her and
					creating horrifying nightmares.She hated it plaguing her.Because of
					that,Lavinda had to go to the hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					She went to the hospital because of a sudden headache disease.There
					was a deadly infection and 55% of people died of this disease.The
					doctor said she was the luckiest of them all because it only effect
					was hallucinations.The doctor said she needed a long sleep.“That’s the
					only cure and no one should interrupt because that will affect her
					health.”announced the posh doctor.Then then she opened her mouth and
					yawned like an angry lion roaring in the Savannah.Her shoulders
					slumped and her arms hung lifelessly by her side.Lavinda’s head slowly
					began to tilt downwards.
				</p>
				<p>
					The unknown shadow was still planning to attack the small,happy
					village.It was strange that the shadow was attacking the village,when
					the village was innocent.But someone was planning to destroy them and
					take over the lovely village.Months passed and there were no more
					cases that included the shadow.But surely had the shadow given up all
					hope?NO!He was planning more cases at the river ever since he had
					known the villagers called it the River of Fear.
				</p>
				<p>
					When Livinda woke up,( she had slept 2day 3hours 58min 59second 99
					milliseconds)she was in her bed,soft and comfortable.She still was a
					little bit sleepy.Then came a dreadful scream.After that came a dead
					silence and you could even hear a pin drop…
